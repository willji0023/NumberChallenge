A project to solve my high school teacher John Dell'armo's
Here is the challenge: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1va_Z5wDe8PU6XSW_IYOYmBPtHE5GkSvC

Aims to brute-force solve any-sized square table given the constraints that there may no repeating number or color in each row, column, or central diagonal.

## Setup
I regretfully chose to do this in C++ for comfort and speed reasons, but I now regret not doing this in python.

This repo is tested on C++14 using g++ 9.2.1

## Usage
TBD

For now, build with `g++ -o BruteForce src/BruteForce.cpp` from the root directory and run the generated executable.
